Welcome to the GO_DSA repository! This repository was created to practice the implementation of algorithms and data structures in Go (Golang). Here, you will find implementations of the following data structures:

- Implemented:
    - Array
    - Linked List
    - Stacks

- Future Implementations:
    - Queues
    - Binary Search Tree (BST)
    - AVL Tree and Red-Black Tree
    - B Tree

Each directory corresponding to these structures will contain clear and commented examples designed to help you understand how these structures work and how to effectively implement them in Go.
