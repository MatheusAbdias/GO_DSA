Welcome to the GO_DSA repository! This repository was created to practice the implementation of algorithms and data structures in Go (Golang). Here, you will find examples of the following data structures:

- Data Structures:
  - `[X]` Array
  - `[X]` Linked List
  - `[X]` Stack
  - `[X]` Queue
  - `[x]` Binary Search Tree (BST)
  - `[ ]` AVL Tree and Red-Black Tree
  - `[ ]` B Tree

Each directory corresponding to these structures will contain clear and commented examples designed to help you understand how these structures work and how to effectively implement them in Go.
